Overview

A rasterizer takes descriptions of coordinates and renders them into pixel values we can display on our screens. This project focused on triangle rasterization that includes antialiasing techniques like supersampling, sampling, and level sampling of multiple mipmaps. The rasterizer also handles affine transformations including rotation, scaling, and translation. The most interesting part of this project was discovering the significant image improvements that came from implementing each of the antialiasing techniques when doing texture mapping.
