		<h2><b>Overview<b></h2>
		<p>A rasterizer takes descriptions of coordinates and renders them into pixel values we can display on our screens. 
		This project focused on triangle rasterization that includes antialiasing techniques like supersampling, sampling, 
		and level sampling of multiple mipmaps. The rasterizer also handles affine transformations including rotation, scaling, 
		and translation. The most interesting part of this project was discovering the significant image improvements that came 
			from implementing each of the antialiasing techniques when doing texture mapping.</p>		
		
		<h3><b> Walk through how you rasterize triangles in your own words. </b></h3>
	
			<p>
We first calculate the bounding box of the triangle by finding the minimum and maximum x value and y values. 
Then we do a three line test (prewritten in the “inside” function within triangulation.cpp) to see if a given 
sample point is within the triangle of interest. We only need to sample the points within our bounding box, 
rather than in our entire pixel buffer. The “inside” function calculates the lines formed by all three triangle vertices. 
Then, it calculates if the vectors formed from the sample point to these lines are all positive 
(if using counter-clockwise edge lines) or all negative (if using clockwise edge lines). For all the sample points
				inside our triangle, we assign the sample buffer at the (x,y) pairing equal to the given color. </p>

			<h3><b> Explain how your algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle.</b></h3>
			
<p>As explained earlier, the algorithm only scans the samples within the calculated bounding box of the triangle to see 
if they are contained within the triangle, therefore, it is not any worse, but it is also not any better.<p>
