<h3>Project write-up guidelines and instructions</h3>
<p>We have provided a simple HTML skeleton in <em>index.html</em> found within the <em>docs</em> directory to help you get started and structure your write-up.</p>
<p>You are also welcome to create your own webpage report from scratch using your own preferred frameworks or tools. However, <strong>please follow the same overall structure as described in the deliverables section below</strong>.</p>
<p>The goals of your write-up are for you to (a) think about and articulate what you've built and learned in your own words, (b) have a write-up of the project to take away from the class. Your write-up should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An overview of the project, your approach to and implementation for each of the parts, and what problems you encountered and how you solved them. Strive for clarity and succinctness.</li>
<li>On each part, make sure to include the results described in the corresponding Deliverables section in addition to your explanation. If you failed to generate any results correctly, provide a brief explanation of why.</li>
<li>The final (optional) part for the art competition is where you have the opportunity to be creative and individual, so be sure to provide a good description of what you were going for and how you implemented it.</li>
<li>Clearly indicate any extra credit items you completed, and provide a thorough explanation and illustration for each of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>The write-up is one of our main methods of evaluating your work, so it is important to spend the time to do it correctly and thoroughly. Plan ahead to allocate time for the write-up well before the deadline.</p>
<h3><a name="rubric"></a>Project Write-up Deliverables and Rubric</h3>
<p>Note that this rubric is rather coarse. The content and quality of your write-up are extremely important, and you should make sure to at <em>least</em> address all the points listed below. The extra credit portions are intended for students who want to challenge themselves and explore methods beyond the fundamentals, and are not worth a large amount of points. In other words, don't necessarily expect to use the extra credit points on these projects to make up for lost points elsewhere.</p>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this project. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the project.</p>
<h4>Task 1 (20 pts)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Walk through how you rasterize triangles in your own words.</li>
<li>Explain how your algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle.</li>
<li>Show a <em>png</em> screenshot of <em>basic/test4.svg</em> with the default viewing parameters and with the pixel inspector centered on an interesting part of the scene.</li>
<li><em>Extra credit:</em> Explain any special optimizations you did beyond simple bounding box triangle rasterization, with a timing comparison table (we suggest using the c++ <code>clock()</code> function around the <code>svg.draw()</code> command in <code>DrawRend::redraw()</code> to compare millisecond timings with your various optimizations off and on).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Task 2 (20 pts)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Walk through your supersampling algorithm and data structures. Why is supersampling useful? What modifications did you make to the rasterization pipeline in the process? Explain how you used supersampling to antialias your triangles.</li>
<li>Show <em>png</em> screenshots of <em>basic/test4.svg</em> with the default viewing parameters and sample rates 1, 4, and 16 to compare them side-by-side. Position the pixel inspector over an area that showcases the effect dramatically; for example, a very skinny triangle corner. Explain why these results are observed.</li>
<li><em>Extra credit:</em> If you implemented alternative antialiasing methods, describe them and include comparison pictures demonstrating the difference between your method and grid-based supersampling.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Task 3 (10 pts)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create an updated version of <em>svg/transforms/robot.svg</em> with cubeman doing something more interesting, like waving or running. Feel free to change his colors or proportions to suit your creativity. Save your <em>svg</em> file as <em>my_robot.svg</em> in your <em>docs/</em> directory and show a <em>png</em> screenshot of your rendered drawing in your write-up. Explain what you were trying to do with cubeman in words.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Task 4 (10 pts)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Explain barycentric coordinates in your own words and use an image to aid you in your explanation. One idea is to use a <em>svg</em> file that plots a single triangle with one red, one green, and one blue vertex, which should produce a smoothly blended color triangle.</li>
<li>Show a <em>png</em> screenshot of <em>svg/basic/test7.svg</em> with default viewing parameters and sample rate 1. If you make any additional images with color gradients, include them.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Task 5 (15 pts)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Explain pixel sampling in your own words and describe how you implemented it to perform texture mapping. Briefly discuss the two different pixel sampling methods, nearest and bilinear.</li>
<li>Check out the <em>svg</em> files in the <em>svg/texmap/</em> directory. Use the pixel inspector to find a good example of where bilinear sampling clearly defeats nearest sampling. Show and compare four <em>png</em> screenshots using nearest sampling at 1 sample per pixel, nearest sampling at 16 samples per pixel, bilinear sampling at 1 sample per pixel, and bilinear sampling at 16 samples per pixel.</li>
<li>Comment on the relative differences. Discuss when there will be a large difference between the two methods and why.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Task 6 (25 pts)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Explain level sampling in your own words and describe how you implemented it for texture mapping.</li>
<li>You can now adjust your sampling technique by selecting pixel sampling, level sampling, or the number of samples per pixel. Describe the tradeoffs between speed, memory usage, and antialiasing power between the three various techniques.</li>
<li>Using a <em>png</em> file you find yourself, show us four versions of the image, using the combinations of <code>L_ZERO</code> and <code>P_NEAREST</code>, <code>L_ZERO</code> and <code>P_LINEAR</code>, <code>L_NEAREST</code> and <code>P_NEAREST</code>, as well as <code>L_NEAREST</code> and <code>P_LINEAR</code>.
<ul>
<li>To use your own <em>png</em>, make a copy of one of the existing <em>svg</em> files in <em>svg/texmap/</em> (or create your own modelled after one of the provided <em>svg</em> files). Then, near the top of the file, change the texture filename to point to your own <em>png</em>. From there, you can run ./draw and pass in that svg file to render it and then save a screenshot of your results.</li>
<li><strong>Note</strong>: Choose a <em>png</em> that showcases the different sampling effects well. You may also want to zoom in/out, use the pixel inspector, etc. to demonstrate the differences.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
